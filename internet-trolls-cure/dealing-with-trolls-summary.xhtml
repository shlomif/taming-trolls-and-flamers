<h1>Dealing with Internet Trolls and Flamers - the Cognitive Therapy Approach</h1>

<p>
You probably heard many different pieces of advice about how to deal with people
who write insulting or provocative remarks on various Internet forums (also 
known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29">"trolls"</a> or flamers. The most notorious of which is "Don't Feed the Trolls",
which says that all the people in the forum should avoid responding to the 
troll. However, as you will see below, <b>"Don't feed the trolls" is also a
wrong and ineffective approach</b> for dealing with trolls.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, I discovered a much better way to handle criticism in the book
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Therapy-Revised-Updated/dp/0380810336">"<b>Feeling Good</b>: The New Mood Therapy" by David D. Burns</a>, which is 
an internationally
best-selling self-help book for learning how to deal with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">clinical
depressions</a> by making use of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">cognitive
therapy</a>, which was proven to be effective in dealing with a variety
of mood disorders. The book has helped me a lot both in learning the cause of
my psychological conditions, and in giving me tools to overcome them.

<p>
This post will focus on a certain chapter in the book called "<b>Verbal
Judo</b>: learn to talk back when you're under the fire of criticism", as
adapted by me to the world of online, Internet-based, communication. 
</p>

<p>
One final note: I am not a mental health professional and this is not
professional psychological advice. I believe anyone is allowed to give such 
insights from their experience and based on material they've read, just like
everyone is allowed to give his opinion on computing or on law, while stating
the usual disclaimer. So don't blame me if this thing back-fires, and use
your own reasoning.

<h2>Case Study</h2>

<p>
Someone joins a Python IRC channel and says "Perl rocks my socks
and Python sucks balls, LOL. Python programmers are incompetent imbecile
losers, ROTFLâ€¦"
</p>

<p>
(I'm giving it about Python to avoid Perl-elitism on my part. I'm also using
"him", "he" consistently, though the troll might be female. )
