<h1>Dealing with Internet Trolls and Flamers - the Cognitive Therapy Approach</h1>

<p>
You probably heard many different pieces of advice about how to deal with people
who write insulting or provocative remarks on various Internet forums (also 
known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29">"trolls"</a> or flamers. The most notorious of which is "Don't Feed the Trolls",
which says that all the people in the forum should avoid responding to the 
troll. However, as you will see below, <b>"Don't feed the trolls" is also a
wrong and ineffective approach</b> for dealing with trolls.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, I discovered a much better way to handle criticism in the book
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Therapy-Revised-Updated/dp/0380810336">"<b>Feeling Good</b>: The New Mood Therapy" by David D. Burns</a>, which is 
an internationally
best-selling self-help book for learning how to deal with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">clinical
depressions</a> by making use of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">cognitive
therapy</a>, which was proven to be effective in dealing with a variety
of mood disorders. The book has helped me a lot both in learning the cause of
my psychological conditions, and in giving me tools to overcome them.

</p>

<p>
This post will focus on a certain chapter in the book called "<b>Verbal
Judo</b>: learn to talk back when you're under the fire of criticism", as
adapted by me to the world of online, Internet-based, communication. 
</p>

<p>
One final note: I am not a mental health professional and this is not
professional psychological advice. I believe anyone is allowed to give such 
insights from their experience and based on material they've read, just like
everyone is allowed to give his opinion on computing or on law, while stating
the usual disclaimer. So don't blame me if this thing back-fires, and use
your own reasoning.
</p>

<h2>Case Study</h2>

<p>
Someone joins a Python IRC channel and says "Perl rocks my socks
and Python sucks balls, LOL. Python programmers are incompetent imbecile
losers, ROTFLâ€¦"
</p>

<p>
(I'm giving it about Python to avoid Perl-elitism on my part. I'm also using
"him", "he" consistently, though the troll might be female. )
</p>

<h2>What not to do?</h2>

<ol>

<li><p>
<b>Criticise his judgement</b>:
<ul>
<li>"Python does not suck, and you are being
rude."</li>
<li>"WTF are you saying? Everybody knows that Perl sucks."</li>
</ul>

<p>
Saying sentences like that will make him madder, will likely yield an even more
aggressive response from the troll, and will only escalate the heat in the 
conversation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Don't feed the troll"</b> - i.e: ignore him. Someone will "feed" 
him eventually and the troll may continue trolling and feeling he's right
and superior or alternatively that the Python people on the channel
are being "jerks" for not responding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Ban him / call for banning him</b> - a great way to get another enemy,
and can also possibly start some "was it right to ban him" converations. Will
also negatively contribute to the channel's atomsphere among the channel
members.
</p>
<p>
The troll may also prove to be a useful resource or can be taught to love
Python eventually.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Tell him not to troll.</b> - you're labelling him and insulting him
and he's feeling like he's alienated. Some people may still respond harshly.</p>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Cancel the project, or close the channel</b> - may seem very far-fetched 
but in a project I was involved in and made some suggestions which were 
perceived as annoying, I was told that it was actually considered to cancel
it. Naturally, this is throwing the baby along with the bathwater, so you
certainly <b>must not</b> do that.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>What to do instead</h2>

<p>
So what should we do instead. It's very simple:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Agree with him</b> (but use a softer language):
<ul>
<li>"Yes, Perl is a nice language, and I agree that Python has its downsides
and/or trade-offs in comparison to Perl."</li>
<li>It's OK to prefer Perl, we'll still accept you here.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Ask him what he means:</b> "Why do you feel that Python is so bad? What 
do you find wrong with it?"
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
And eventually <b>negotiate a common ground:</b>
"Would you agree that some people like Perl
better and some like Python better? (And some may like both equally.). Maybe
you can still write Python code and be productive in it while still not in
love with it. Who knows, maybe you'll even grow to like it. Feel free to stick
around and ask questions."
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Repeat that a few times and the troll will eventually calm down and will
become a harmless hobbit.
</p>

<p>
(After I originally read that in Feeling Good, I immediately thought that it
made immediate sense, and that it will likely work in most cases. However,
later I've thought that I probably would not have thought about it myself.)

<h2>Practising</h2>

<p>
The rest of this post is about some more useful advice for communicating
with people who are making provocative statements, and can be read at your
own leisure. After you've read that, you may wish to practice what was said
here using role-playing, by one of the following scenarios:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Someone comes on a FreeBSD channel, and claims that Linux and the
GPL have "won" and that the BSD licence and the BSD clones have no future.
</li>
<li>
Someone joins a channel of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a>
and claims that the GPL licence is an "evil", anti-capitalistic and
anti-commercial licence, that does a lot of harm to the open source world.
</li>
<li>
You are talking on a Perl channel, when someone joins and says that "Perl is
dead".
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can think of others.
