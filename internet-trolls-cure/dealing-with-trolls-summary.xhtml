<h1>Dealing with Internet Trolls and Flamers - the Cognitive Therapy Approach</h1>

<p>
You probably heard many different pieces of advice about how to deal with people
who write insulting or provocative remarks on various Internet forums (also 
known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29">"trolls"</a> or flamers. The most notorious of which is "Don't Feed the Trolls",
which says that all the people in the forum should avoid responding to the 
troll. However, as you will see below, <b>"Don't feed the trolls" is also a
wrong and ineffective approach</b> for dealing with trolls.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, I discovered a much better way to handle criticism in the book
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Therapy-Revised-Updated/dp/0380810336">"<b>Feeling Good</b>: The New Mood Therapy" by David D. Burns</a>, which is 
an internationally
best-selling self-help book for learning how to deal with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">clinical
depressions</a> by making use of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">cognitive
therapy</a>, which was proven to be effective in dealing with a variety
of mood disorders. The book has helped me a lot both in learning the cause of
my psychological conditions, and in giving me tools to overcome them.

This post will focus on a certain chapter in the book called "<b>Verbal
